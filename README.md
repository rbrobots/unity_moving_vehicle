# unity_moving_vehicle

This was programmed in Unity and makes use of the Standard Asset library. To enter and exit the vehicle, I modified a script that I found online.

This script needs to be placed in the Assets folder. It needs to be used with the Car Controller and Car User Control scripts from the Standard Asset library.
